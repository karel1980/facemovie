# Facemovie

This project aims to produce videos in the style of "picasa face movie".
Example (generated by picasa) here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLQtssJDMMc

## Usage

1. Create a python environment (or don't, you do you)

    python -mvenv env
    . env/bin/activate
   
2. Install dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Run the gui to select images and faces. When you're done, save your project. It's a json file but the extension doesn't matter.

    python gui.py

## CLI usage

When you have a project file, you can generate the movie from the command line.

    python generate_movie.py <project.json> movie.mov

## possible improvements:

* Use face identification to automatically select the correct face
* Get rid of the possible mismatches between faces detected by mediapipe and face_recognition libraries
* GUI: allow reordering images
* Video generator: take the selected face into account 
* Show progress bar while generating the video
* Packaging, choose a file extension for the project file
* Allow specifying settings when using the cli to generate a movie
