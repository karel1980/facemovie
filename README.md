This project aims to produce "picasa face movie" videos
Example (generated by picasa) here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLQtssJDMMc

## Usage

1. Create a python environment (or don't, you do you)

    python -mvenv env

2. Install dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Try it

    run.py
   
## Bazinga

This project is not finished yet.
The 'run.py' script serves as a proof of concept for rotating, scaling and centering
faces using mediapipe.

Shortcomings:
- Does not focus on a specific face (no face recognition)
- No effort was done to generate the actual video file.
