# Facemovie

This project aims to produce "picasa face movie" videos
Example (generated by picasa) here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLQtssJDMMc

## Usage

1. Create a python environment (or don't, you do you)

    python -mvenv env
    . env/bin/activate
   
2. Install dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Run the gui to select images and faces. When you're done, save your project. It's a json file but the extension doesn't matter.

    python gui.py

4. Generate the movie

    python generate_movie.py <project.json> movie.mov

## possible improvements:

* Use face identification to automatically select the correct face
* Get rid of the possible mismatches between faces detected by mediapipe and face_recognition libraries
* Write the video file straight from the GUI
* Packaging, choose a file extension for the project file
* Move fps to settings
* Add border to images before rotating/scaling (color/thickness in settings)
